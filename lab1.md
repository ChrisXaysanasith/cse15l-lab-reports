The usage of change directory has no effect when calledupon as the example image given, the output is empty
due to there being no path.

* CD with a path arg

Changing the directory with an argument results in going into the relative path ./lecture1 , making the absolute path /home/lecture1

* CD with a path to file arg

Changing the directory with an argument to a file results to an error, because a directory is a folder that holds the file therefore it will error because it is accessing a file, not the folder containing the file.

**LS**

* LS with no arg

The usage of list, gives the files and folders in the given directory which the directory we will be working with is /home

* LS with a path arg

I am listing the directory of messages therefore the files that are listed contain the contents of Hello World in a certain language file

* LS with a path to file arg

The way I am listing the path to a file only lists the absolute path of the file
