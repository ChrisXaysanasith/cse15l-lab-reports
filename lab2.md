the url.getPath().contains("/add-message")) gets called, therefore the arguments required in this is /add-message then if the query contains s= which results in /add-message?s= then when you put a string after the end of s= 
the number will be added, the = will split the string, value is empty right now then the value gets applied when you apply a string, the try and catch will also be ran for the string to format it. Then the stringSearch will apply the string to the value.

This week I learned how to use SSH and understand how to make a new directory, these are the things I have never used in my daily life, therefore understanding these commands have taught me how to remote into a server, giving me more knowledge on how SSH works.
